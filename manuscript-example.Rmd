There are many pre-prepared latex document classes that will format your document so that you get a beautifully formatted document for zero work. See the link below for many examples.

Notice the template in the style of the American Journal of Agricultural Economics is 'ajae', which is listed in the 'economic' package in the link above. 

Students will also want to try, 'uiucthesis' as the documentclass option.


Also, 'article' is the default class and worth using for working papers. Replace the YAML front matter with what is below.

# Introduction 

This repository contains a template for a reproducable research project. The fundamental idea of reproducable research is that the steps that take your research from raw data to manuscript, thesis, or report should be fully automated. This way, your work can be checked by your advisor, mentors, collaborators, others working in your area, journal reviewers, and your future self. The last being the most important.
