**interrupted Goode Homolosine equal-area coordinate system**  

_Crowther 2015_: All covariates were reprojected to the interrupted Goode Homolosine equal-area coordinate system (which maximises spatial precision by amalgamating numerous region-specific equal-area projections) to optimize the areal accuracy of our final figures (_Citation: Steinwand, R. S., Hutchinson, J. A. & Snyder, J. P. Map projections for global and continental data sets and an analysis of pixel distortion caused by reprojection. Photogramm. Eng. Remote Sensing 61, 1487â€“1499 (1995)_)  


### Resampling
- Resample to 1 km2 resolution  
- Will coregistration be necessary? Nearest neighbor should probably be used
