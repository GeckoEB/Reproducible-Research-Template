# Research Project Template

This repository contains a template for a reproducable research project. The fundamental idea of reproducable research is that the steps that take your research from raw data to manuscript, thesis, or report should be fully automated. This way, your work can be checked by your advisor, mentors, collaborators, others working in your area, journal reviewers, and your future self. 

I became interested in reproducable research because I was tired of being terrified of my own analysis. I was constantly petrified someone would question my work and ask me to open the black box and verify what I did was correct; in some cases even being asked reproduce a result was terrifiying
